### Hello stranger.
### My name is Bess (she/her/hers). I am a junior at Southwestern University studying computer science. This fall, I'll be learning about database management and computational organization.
### I am interested in data science, the application of ethics in AI and machine learning, and UX design that focuses on accessibility.
### Fun fact: Two of my favorite book series are "The Magicians" trilogy and "The Themis Files" trilogy.
